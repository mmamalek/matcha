This project is about creating a dating website.

We need to create an app allowing two potential lovers
to meet. The app must take them from registration to the
final encounter.

A user must be able to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item register
    \item connect
    \item verify account
    \item add pictures
\end{itemize}
A user must fill his/her profile with data that aids them in matching.
They must be able to search and look into the profile of other users
matching their preferences.

They must have the ability to 'chat' with those who have liked them.
