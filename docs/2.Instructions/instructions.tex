This project is built using primarily JavaScript. The front is
a react-app with a material-UI bootstrap. The backend is a
Node.js app with an Express router and SocketIO.

The database is MySQL with no ORM, validators or User Accounts
Manager.

The server is the Node built-in Web-Server but you may run Apache or Nginx.

The Website/Web Application is usable on a mobile phone and the layout
works even on a smaller resolution with the Header, Footer and Main sections
maintaining a proper layout.

Security is a priority and these are conditions to prevent or protect against:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Plain-text passwords stored in Database
    \item Code injection of "user" Javascript in unprotected variables
    \item Upload unwanted content
    \item Alter SQL request
    \item SQL Injection of any kind
\end{itemize}
